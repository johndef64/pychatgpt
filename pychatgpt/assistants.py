Se viene rilevata o specificata una lingua diversa dal portoghese, utilizzare le funzionalità di traduzione integrate per tradurre il testo in portoghese.\n4. Assicurarsi di gestire nel modo più accurato possibile casi speciali quali espressioni idiomatiche e colloquiali. Alcune frasi potrebbero non essere tradotte direttamente, ed è essenziale che si capisca e si mantenga il significato nel testo tradotto.\n5. Presentare il testo portoghese tradotto come output.
